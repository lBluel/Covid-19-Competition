# COVID-19 Infection Percentage Estimation
Since late 2019, the world been in health crisis because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, using Medical Imagery has proved to be efficient in detecting Covid-19 Infection. These Medical Imaging include: X-ray, CT-scans and Ultrasounds. The use of CT-scans is not only limited to the detection of COVID-19 cases, but they can also be used for other important tasks such quantifying the infection and monitoring the evolution of the disease, which can help in treatment and save the patientâ€™s life. In this challenge, the participants will use a dataset labelled by two expert radiologists, who estimated the Covid-19 infection, to train and validate their approaches. In the testing phase, participants will test their approaches using a test dataset collected from various CT-scanners and recording settings.

## Dataset
The challenge has three sets: Train, Val, and Test. The Train set is obtained from 132 CT-scans, from which 128 CT-scans has confirmed to have Covid-19 based on positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and CT scan manifestations identified by two experienced thoracic radiologists. The rest four CT-scans have not any infection type (Healthy). The Val set is obtained from 57 CT-scans, from which 55 CT-scans has confirmed to have Covid-19 based on positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and CT scan manifestations identified by two experienced thoracic radiologists. The rest two CT-scans have not any infection type (Healthy).

### Training Data
The Train split has two files: Images (Slices) Folder and Labeling Folder ('.csv' file) that contains the labels for each Slice (Image). The Train Split can be downloaded from the [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vPYMrL_IwC_wOxff3wX_Rg1iIJyNl2Dc?usp=sharing).

### Validation Blind Data
The validation dataset contains 1034 images with no label. The Validation Split can be downloaded from the [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18V_u6Vo75a_A5RlUH80UcXh3i0rc5keE?usp=sharing).
